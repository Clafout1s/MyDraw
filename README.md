# MyDraw
MyDraw is a beginner project that I am making in order to learn the basics of OpenGL.  
My intent is to make a software similar to MsPaint: drawing, changing brush size and erasing are the only features planned for now.  

## Installation
Clone the present repository, and from your terminal, go to the build folder.  
```cmake ../src``` will prepare the project for compilation, and ```make``` will compile the project.   
Once you launched cmake, you shouldn't have to relaunch it, and should only need a make if you changed the code.   
Then, launch the ```./App``` executable, and the software window will open up.

## How to use
Press escape to draw squares. If you maintain the button while moving the mouse, you will draw.
