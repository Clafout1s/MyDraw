# MyDraw
MyDraw is a beginner project that I am making in order to learn the basics of OpenGL.  
It is a bare bones drawing program, in the inspiration of MS Paint.
You can draw in multiple colors on the screen, and erase parts of it.

## Installation
Clone the present repository, and from your terminal, go to the build folder.  
```cmake ../src``` will prepare the project for compilation, and ```make``` will compile the project.   
Once you launched cmake, you shouldn't have to relaunch it, and should only need a make if you changed the code.   
Then, launch the ```./App``` executable, and the software window will open up.

## Controls
- Left click to draw or erase (depends of the mode)
- D to go into Draw mode
- E to go into Erase mode
- C to clear the screen
- \+ to grow the size of the pencil
- \- to reduce the size of the pencil
- Keypad numbers to change colors
    - 1: Orange
    - 2: White
    - 3: Black
    - 4: Pink
    - 5: Yellow
    - 6: Purple
    - 7: Red
    - 8: Green
    - 9: Blue
    - 0 to activate Debug Mode: allows to see the rectangles with random colors, to see how they are formed and modified
